# getaround-google-sync

A tool to sync your Getaround cars' calendars with your Google calendar.

In short, this is what it will support:
* [ ] Someone makes a new reservation on your car -> It shows up on your Google Calendar
* [ ] You add an event on your Google Calendar -> It blocks the time off on your car's calendar

That way, you don't need to be logging in to different websites in order to manage your car.

This tool works best for Getaround hosts who aren't dealing with a large fleet of cars, but rather
just their own personal car(s), for which they want to block times off regularly for personal use.

This will work similarly to CarSync, except CarSync only syncs the Getaround and Turo calendars with
each other, but doesn't allow syncing to your Google Calendar.
